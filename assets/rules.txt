Hand and Brain chess is a chess variant intended to play in pairs. One player will be the brain, and the other is the hand. The brain calls out a piece, and the hand chooses how and where to move that piece. Tap a role card below to learn more about each role.

The hand has the role of choosing which piece to move depending on what the brain has decided to call out. The hand should only move pieces that are called by the brain even if the only possible moves are bad.
